## Resilience Project
This was a research study at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai that looked for people resistant or resilient to disease. I served as PI and led a grant-funded effort to identify Lyme resistant individuals and characterize their antibody repertoires.

## N1 app
This was an app-based single person multiple crossover trial platform. Initially lead by Noah Zimmerman, who later passed the torch to me at Mount Sinai. The first study enabled people to evaluate whether nootropics changed cognition compared to a baseline period with no intervention.

## Open Humans
This is a nonprofit I co-founded with Mad Ball who is the current Exec Director.

## DIYbio.org
This is a nonprofit I co-founded with Mac Cowell in 2008 to create resources for the nascent DIY biology community. We have prototyped a few services over the years, such as the "Ask a Biosafety Officer" (retired) and DIYbioshpere (ongoing).  

## PersonalGenomes.org
This is a nonprofit I co-founded with George Church to organize the international Personal Genome Project consortium: a collection of research studies that invited people to open source their biology for the benefit of humankind.

## GET Conference
An annual conference I produced for many years, that explored new omic technologies and their potential impacts. We always reserved half the seats for participants in the Personal Genome Project. Each year there were interactive elements, typically some new profiling tech or study.

## DNA Direct
One of the earliest direct-to-consumer genetic testing companies, founded by Ryan Phelan. I was an early employee (biz dev). While the norm now, DTC was treated as a four-letter word in 2005.
